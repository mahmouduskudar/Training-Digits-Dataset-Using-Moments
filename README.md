# Training-Digits-Dataset-Using-Moments
explores extracting insights from digital images using moments and contour analysis. Moments calculate object characteristics such as area, centroid, and orientation. Contour analysis identifies object boundaries and computes areas and perimeters. Project demonstrates how these techniques improve shape analysis, identification, and classification.
